**Text editor:**\
A basic text editor allowing you to type anywhere on the screen, with a movable cursor.
- You can move the cursor using the arrow keys.
- Enter key starts a new line.
- the 1 key restarts the program - (will be changed to esc when I figure out how to do that).

- Uses "util.h" a header file I made myself!
